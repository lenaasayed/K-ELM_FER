# K-ELM_FER
The aim of this module is to classify human facial expressions from face image, I used classical machine learning techniques so that it requires less compute and complexity.
In this model I used GCN to enhance input image as preprocessing step, DLTP feature descriptor, PCA to reduce the high-dimensional DLTP features and K-ELM classifier to classify the face expression
